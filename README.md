# UNP_REGRESSION_PROJECT_WITH_PYTHON_-STOCK-MARKET-DATASET_ANALYSIS
During my internship at United Network of Professionals (UNP Education), I developed a Machine Learning project in Python to predict students’ final grades based on academic and behavioral factors. I performed data cleaning, handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key performance indicators. Using models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, I evaluated results with metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² score. The Random Forest model delivered the most accurate predictions, demonstrating strong generalization ability. This project strengthened my skills in data preprocessing, model building, and performance evaluation using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.
